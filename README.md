# file-copy
Please create two folders before running the program. One named "res" and another one named "out".  
You need to place the files you want to copy in the "res" folder, but the program will automatically search in the root folder if no files were found there.  
The copied files will be outputted to the "out" folder.  
These files were not uploaded to github because github doesn't allow to upload empty folders. I am thinking about fixing that problem in the future.
