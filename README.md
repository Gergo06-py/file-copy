# file-copy
Please create two folders before running the program. One named "__res__" and another one named "__out__".  
You need to place the files you want to copy in the "__res__" folder, but the program will automatically search in the root folder if no files were found there.  
The copied files will be outputted to the "__out__" folder.  
These files were not uploaded to github because github doesn't allow to upload empty folders. I am thinking about fixing that problem in the future.
